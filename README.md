# TMD â€” Twitter Media Downloader

Chrome plugin to download images and videos from Twitter

## Contributions
This is a rip-off from [Flkala's](https://github.com/Flkalas) [Twitter Media Assist](https://github.com/Flkalas/TwitterMediaAssist) with significant fixes:

* Download individual images & videos from tweets with more than 1 asset
* Simplified options. Both Videos and Images are downloaded as .MP4
* Doesn't inadvertently open the 'analytics' page when clicking the download button
* Keeps open the tweet modal window when clicking the download button
* Download button hover animation restored, less suceptible to Twitter UI changing
* A couple of bugs fixed

Other enhancements:
* Migrated to TypeScript
* Code typos fixed
* Libraries updated
* Slimmed down code
